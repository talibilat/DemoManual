We understand this is an initial step in your weight loss journey towards healthy living, and we’re here for every bump in the road. Just let us know if you have any worries, feedback or questions.

As a first step, it’s important for you to take the time to read the manufacturer’s patient information leaflet enclosed in your box. This gives you everything you need to know about how to take the medication, what to avoid, side effects and potential interactions with other medications.

## What is Wegovy

Wegovy contains a hormone called GLP-1 that occurs naturally in the gut. Its purpose is to regulate appetite and provide a feeling of fullness for an extended period, helping to reduce cravings and keep you satisfied after meals. By targeting the receptors responsible for appetite in the brain, this medication helps to lower the body's natural ‘set point’, which is the weight it strives to maintain. Since Wegovy reduces your appetite, it gives you the opportunity to make healthier choices and reduce your calorie intake to optimise your weight loss.

## How does Wegovy work?

In a nutshell

1\. Reduces appetite—so you are less hungry

2\. Reduces cravings—so it’s easier to make healthy choices

3\. Reduces your set point—so you can lose more weight before starting to plateau

## Wegovy Titrations

Wegovy is available in 5 different dose strengths – 0.25mg, 0.5mg, 1mg, 1.7mg & 2.4mg. You start Wegovy at a dose of 0.25 mg once a week and increase the dose every 4 weeks until you reach 1mg. It is essential that your starting dose is 0.25mg - if you have received any other strength, please get in touch with our customer support team before starting your treatment.

If you'd like to, you can also increase to 1.7mg and 2.4mg for enhanced appetite suppression but this is optional. The dose is gradually increased to allow your body to get used to the medication and minimise any side effects you might experience.

## How to take Wegovy?

You need to inject Wegovy once a week (on the same day each week), under the skin. It should be injected in the abdomen (keep 5cm away from your belly button), upper legs or upper arms. We advise you to mix up your injection sites each week to minimise discomfort.

Watch our video about how to take Wegovy before you start your treatment: [How to take Wegovy](https://www.joinvoy.com/videos/how-to-take-wegovy)

## How to store Wegovy

You can keep the pen for 6 weeks when stored at a temperature below 30°C or in a refrigerator (2°C to 8°C). Do not freeze your medication and keep it away from the freezer compartment.

When you are not using the pen, keep the pen cap on in order to protect it from light.

Please do not use your medicine if the solution is not clear and colourless or almost colourless.

You should start using your treatment within 7 days of receiving it and finish using it within 6 weeks from the date on the Voy pharmacy label applied to your medication.

Once you’ve used your needles and finished your pen, you can dispose of it in the sharps bin provided. Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. If you’re unable to use your sharps bin, ask your pharmacist how to throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment.

These instructions are supplementary to the information provided in the patient information leaflet in your medication box which you’ll receive within your order.

","Yes, according to the context provided, the use of GLP-1 medications, when prescribed and monitored by medical experts, is generally considered a safe and effective way to manage weight loss. The treatments are well-tolerated and have shown impressive results, such as up to 10% weight loss within the first six months.

","The approval process at Voy works as follows:

1. **Complete Two Tasks**: After placing your order, you need to upload a full-length photo of yourself (taken on the day for the consultation) and a photo of your ID. These photos help verify your identity and BMI, which are crucial for online prescriptions and maintaining high standards of care.

2. **Clinical Review**: The Clinical Team reviews your photos and medical history. If approved, your medication will be dispatched within 1-3 working days.

3. **Follow-Up (if needed)**: If more information is needed, the Clinical Team will message you through your account's messages feature.

If your tasks are not approved, you will be prompted to submit a new photo. If your order is not approved, you will be informed why, and your order will be canceled with any pending payments released within 5 working days.",True,1.0,0.9409908300690337,59.51872801780701
