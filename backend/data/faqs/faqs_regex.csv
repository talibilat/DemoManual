We understand this is an initial step in your weight loss journey towards healthy living, and we’re here for every bump in the road. Just let us know if you have any worries, feedback or questions.

As a first step, it’s important for you to take the time to read the manufacturer’s patient information leaflet enclosed in your box. This gives you everything you need to know about how to take the medication, what to avoid, side effects and potential interactions with other medications.

## What is Wegovy

Wegovy contains a hormone called GLP-1 that occurs naturally in the gut. Its purpose is to regulate appetite and provide a feeling of fullness for an extended period, helping to reduce cravings and keep you satisfied after meals. By targeting the receptors responsible for appetite in the brain, this medication helps to lower the body's natural ‘set point’, which is the weight it strives to maintain. Since Wegovy reduces your appetite, it gives you the opportunity to make healthier choices and reduce your calorie intake to optimise your weight loss.

## How does Wegovy work?

In a nutshell

1\. Reduces appetite—so you are less hungry

2\. Reduces cravings—so it’s easier to make healthy choices

3\. Reduces your set point—so you can lose more weight before starting to plateau

## Wegovy Titrations

Wegovy is available in 5 different dose strengths – 0.25mg, 0.5mg, 1mg, 1.7mg & 2.4mg. You start Wegovy at a dose of 0.25 mg once a week and increase the dose every 4 weeks until you reach 1mg. It is essential that your starting dose is 0.25mg - if you have received any other strength, please get in touch with our customer support team before starting your treatment.

If you'd like to, you can also increase to 1.7mg and 2.4mg for enhanced appetite suppression but this is optional. The dose is gradually increased to allow your body to get used to the medication and minimise any side effects you might experience.

## How to take Wegovy?

You need to inject Wegovy once a week (on the same day each week), under the skin. It should be injected in the abdomen (keep 5cm away from your belly button), upper legs or upper arms. We advise you to mix up your injection sites each week to minimise discomfort.

Watch our video about how to take Wegovy before you start your treatment: [How to take Wegovy](https://www.joinvoy.com/videos/how-to-take-wegovy)

## How to store Wegovy

You can keep the pen for 6 weeks when stored at a temperature below 30°C or in a refrigerator (2°C to 8°C). Do not freeze your medication and keep it away from the freezer compartment.

When you are not using the pen, keep the pen cap on in order to protect it from light.

Please do not use your medicine if the solution is not clear and colourless or almost colourless.

You should start using your treatment within 7 days of receiving it and finish using it within 6 weeks from the date on the Voy pharmacy label applied to your medication.

Once you’ve used your needles and finished your pen, you can dispose of it in the sharps bin provided. Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. If you’re unable to use your sharps bin, ask your pharmacist how to throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment.

These instructions are supplementary to the information provided in the patient information leaflet in your medication box which you’ll receive within your order.

## What is Mounjaro

Mounjaro is a new medication that activates the receptors of two hormones found in the digestive tract known as GLP-1 and GIP which increase after we eat. They combine to provide a feeling of fullness for an extended period. By also targeting receptors in the brain it helps to lower the ‘set point’ which is the weight it ordinarily strives to maintain. Mounjaro gives you the opportunity and makes it easier to opt for healthier choices to reduce your calorie intake to optimise your weight loss.

If you would like to know even more about how Mounjaro works you can learn more from the following site: [Mounjaro.com.](https://www.mounjaro.com/)

## How does Mounjaro work?

In a nutshell:

1. Reduces appetite – so you are less hungry
2. Reduces cravings – so it’s easier to make healthy choices
3. Reduces your set point – so you can lose more weight before reaching a plateau

## Mounjaro Titrations

Mounjaro comes in six different dose strengths: 2.5mg, 5mg, 7.5mg, 10mg, 12.5mg and 15mg. You’ll start Mounjaro at a dose of 2.5mg once a week and increase the dose every 4 weeks, automatically, until you reach the full dose of 15mg by month 6.

The dose is gradually increased to allow your body to get used to the medication and minimise any side effects you might experience. Unless otherwise agreed with a clinician, it is essential that your starting dose is 2.5mg - if you have received any other strength, please get in touch with our customer support team before starting your treatment.

If you do not want to increase your dose every 4 weeks, please speak to our Medical Team or Customer Care Team, and we'll update your subscription.

## Why is there excess liquid after my fourth dose?

Every Mounjaro Kwikpen comes with four doses of medication and enough liquid to prime your pen before every dose.

This means that you will see an excess of liquid in your pen after you’ve taken your four doses. This is to be expected and should not be something to worry about.

Please do not attempt to take more than 4 doses of your medication, attempting to use your pen more than four times will lock your pen and you’ll no longer be able to access the liquid.

## Where can I find the expiry date for my Mounjaro pen?

You can find the expiry date of your medication on the side of your medication box. This will be shown as ‘EXP: DATE’. The expiry date refers to the end of the month that is noted.

## How do I take Mounjaro?

Mounjaro is injected once a week (on the same day each week), under the skin, in the subcutaneous fat. It should be injected in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm (it’s advisable to rotate to a slightly different part of your body each time you inject, this minimises potential discomfort/irritation).

Please note that the medication is contained within the clear chamber in the pen, not the individual needles – these are used to deliver each dose.

Watch our step-by-step guide on how to take your Mounjaro before you start your treatment: [How to take Mounjaro](https://www.joinvoy.com/videos/how-to-take-mounjaro)

## How to store your Mounjaro

You should store Mounjaro in the refrigerator between 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). If needed, each pen can be stored at room temperature up to 30°C ( 86°F) for up to 30 days.

Once you've started the pen, it must be used within 30 days of the first dose.

These instructions are supplementary to the information provided in the patient information leaflet in your medication box provided with each order.

Do not use this medicine if the solution is not clear and colourless or almost colourless (slightly yellow).

Once you’ve used your needles and finished your pen, you can dispose of it in the sharps bin provided. Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. If you’re unable to use your sharps bin, ask your pharmacist how to throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment.

If you’ve missed a dose of your Mounjaro or Wegovy treatment, don’t worry. We've put together this helpful guide to help you understand what to do next. Following these steps ensures that you stay on track with your treatment and can resume as safely and effectively as possible.

- **Missed 1 Dose**:
  - You can take it **as soon as you remember** and continue your injections on this day moving forward. Alternatively, you can wait until your next scheduled dose and administer it then.
- **Missed More Than 2 Doses**:
  - Please contact our clinical team, as a **dose adjustment to a lower stength** may be needed to ensure your safety.

- **Want to Change Your Injection Day?**
  - Make sure at least 4 days have passed since your last injection before giving the next dose. This might mean extending the gap between doses longer than the usual 7 days to shift your schedule.

For personalized guidance or if you have any concerns, you can contact our clinical team directly through your account or book a call with them here: [Book a Call with Clinicians](https://www.joinvoy.com/book).

We're working hard to make it as easy as possible for you to manage your subscription. However, given the time-sensitive nature of your administering cycle, there are some limitations. Here's how you can manage various aspects of your account and subscription:

## How do I update my account details?

We aim to make it as easy as possible for you to keep your account up to date.

You can edit certain details, such as billing method, delivery address and general account preferences by:

If you're changing your shipping address, please make sure to do this before your next order is placed.

## How can I amend my next order date?

To amend your next order date:

1. [Log into your online account](http://joinvoy.com/login)
2. Click on [Account](https://www.joinvoy.com/account) in the left-hand menu settings
3. Select ' [Manage Plans](https://www.joinvoy.com/account/myplans)'
4. Choose a date that works for you

Your payment and order will then process on the new date you've selected. Please note that due to the time-sensitive administration of our prescription medications, there is a limit of 18 days to how far an order can be pushed back.

If you can't see this option on your account, you can contact our Customer Care Team. They will be able to adjust your next order date for you.

In your email, please include:

- The reason why you'd like to change your next order date

6. Click ‘Manage’
7. Select a New Date: Choose an order date that works best for you

Note: Due to the time-sensitive nature of our prescription medications, you can only push your order date back by 21 days or move it forward by up to 7 days.

Your order and payment will now be processed on the selected date and should arrive 1-3 days after this date.

If your order has already been processed or is due to be processed that day, you'll be unable to amend the next order date of this order.

## What if I can’t select the date I need?

If you need to move your order date back by more than 18 days, speak to our Customer Care Team either via livechat from your account or by emailing [help@joinvoy.com](mailto:help@joinvoy.com) and they’ll be happy to help.

Due to prescribing regulations, we're currently only licensed to prescribe and deliver to addresses within the UK.

## Reasons for UK-Only Service

1. **Prescribing Regulations**: Current prescribing regulations restrict us from providing our services internationally.

2. **Legal Compliance**: To ensure we're operating within the bounds of the law and providing the safest possible service, we must limit our operations to the UK.


Travelling Abroad?

If you're currently signed up to Voy and you will be travelling outside of the UK for your next delivery, we can amend your next order date so that your treatment arrives before or after your trip.

Reach out to our Customer Care Team by emailing [help@joinvoy.com](mailto:help@joinvoy.com) or using the livechat feature on your online account with the dates of your travel and your preferred order date and we'll update this for you.

During your weight loss journey, you'll be asked to upload photos. This is so we can monitor your progress and safely prescribe your medication. Here's how to upload photos at each stage:

## During Sign up & Safety Checks

Once you've signed up to Voy, you'll be asked to complete two tasks:

1) upload a full-length photo of yourself taken that day

2) upload a photo of your ID

You can upload your photos to the tasks located on the [Home](https://www.joinvoy.com/account/home) page of your online account. If you have tasks to complete you'll find them here.

If you've been asked to complete a task but can't see any tasks on your account. You can upload photos to your [Messages](https://www.joinvoy.com/account/messages) with our Clinical Team on your [Support](https://www.joinvoy.com/account/support) page by clicking the paper clip icon in the text box.

If you're still unable to upload your photos, please speak to our Customer Care Team who will be happy to help you upload your photos to your tasks.

You might also find this FAQ helpful: [How does the approval process work?](https://joinvoy.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/24609569961876-How-does-the-approval-process-work)

## Why do we ask for photos?

Throughout your weight loss journey, we might ask you to upload new photos to help us monitor and review your progress towards your goal weight. This is to make sure we're safely prescribing medication at every step of your journey.

Your photos are only viewed by our Clinical Team for the purpose of reviewing your eligibility.

## How can I track my progress?

You can also track your own progress within the Voy app by either submitting your weight or a photo of yourself.

Open the Voy app and click on 'Progress' from the menu at the bottom of the screen. Here you can add photos and track your progress.

If you decide you'd no longer like to see your photos you can enable 'privacy mode' by clicking on Timeline and then the 'eye' icon in the left-hand corner.

You can download the Voy app on both the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/voy-weight-loss-programme/id6471655955) and [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.manual.voy).

At Voy, we're committed to providing you with the best possible service and support for your weight loss journey. Our returns policy is designed to ensure your safety while adhering to legal requirements for prescription medications.

## Prescription Medications

- **Cancellation Window**: You can only cancel an order up until the point at which the prescription is approved by our medical team.
- **After Approval**: Once a prescription-only medication has been approved, we cannot cancel the order or accept a return of the items.

This policy is in line with the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000, which exempts prescription medications from standard return rights.

## Legal Basis

The regulations state that consumers don't have the right to cancel a contract for:

_""...the supply of goods made to the consumer's specifications or clearly personalised or which by reason of their nature cannot be returned or are liable to deteriorate or expire rapidly.""_

## Non-Prescription Items

For non-prescription items, we accept returns up to 14 days after purchase. Please contact our Customer Care Team at [help@joinvoy.com](mailto:help@joinvoy.com ""mailto:help@joinvoy.com"") for a returns label.

## Our Commitment

While we can't accept returns on prescription items, we're here to support you throughout your treatment. If you have any concerns or questions about your medication, please don't hesitate to reach out to our Clinical Team.

Your health and satisfaction are our top priorities, and we're committed to ensuring you have the best possible experience with Voy.

You can find all the information about your subscription on your online account and your treatment plan. Here's what you need to know:

## How regularly will I receive my medication?

Depending on your treatment, your subscription will automatically renew every 28 or 42 days.

To find your renewal frequency, you can:

1. Check your treatment plan from your Support page under [Messages](https://www.joinvoy.com/account/messages)
2. View your plan under [Account](https://www.joinvoy.com/account) and then [Manage Plans](https://www.joinvoy.com/account/myplans)

As we're a subscription-based service, your next pen will automatically be sent to you in line with your treatment plan. So, there's no need to place another order.

For Mounjaro, your dose will automatically increase every month up to 10mg, and for Wegovy, your dose will automatically increase up to 1mg. However, please know that each order is subject to clinical approval.

Our system will automatically take your payment using the [billing method](https://www.joinvoy.com/account/details) you added to your online account.

To check when your last order took place, visit [Order History](https://www.joinvoy.com/account/order-history) from your [Account](https://www.joinvoy.com/account) page.

## What if my subscription says expired?

Don't worry if you see this! For safeguarding reasons, our Clinician Team needs to approve your medication before it's sent.

- Your plan will show as expired on a monthly basis
- Your subscription will still be active and renewed unless cancelled

## What if I reach my goal weight?

Congratulations! We're always really happy to see people feeling happier and healthier.

At Voy, we're committed to providing safe and effective weight loss solutions. Our approval process ensures that we're prescribing the right treatment for you. Here's how it works:

## 1\. Complete Two Tasks

After placing your order, you'll need to:

1. Upload a full-length photo of yourself (taken on the day for the consultation)
2. Upload a photo of your ID

These photos help us verify your identity and BMI, which is crucial for online prescriptions and maintaining high standards of care.

## 2\. Clinical Review

Our Clinical Team will review your photos and medical history. If approved, your medication will be dispatched within 1-3 working days.

## 3\. Follow-Up (if needed)

If we need more information, our Clinical Team will message you through your account's [messages](https://www.joinvoy.com/account/messages ""https://www.joinvoy.com/account/messages"") feature.

## What if my tasks are not approved?

- If your photo isn't approved, you'll see a new task on your home page to submit a new one.
- You can also upload photos directly in your [messages](https://www.joinvoy.com/account/messages ""https://www.joinvoy.com/account/messages"") to the Clinical Team.

## What if my order is not approved?
